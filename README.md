# Tasker

Tasker is a simple and user-friendly to-do list application that allows users to create, manage, and track their daily tasks, all in one place. With a basic layout consisting of a header, input field, and list of tasks, users can easily add, mark, and delete tasks with the help of JavaScript.

The app is responsive and mobile-friendly, and uses local storage to save tasks. Users can delete individual tasks or clear the entire list if they want to start fresh.
